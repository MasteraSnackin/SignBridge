## 💡 Why This Matters

The **Android SDK Command-line Tools** include:
- `sdkmanager` - Required to accept licenses
- `apksigner` - Required to sign APK files
- `adb` - Required to install on devices

Without these tools:
- ❌ Cannot accept Android licenses
- ❌ Cannot build APK files
- ❌ Cannot test on devices
- ❌ Cannot complete the project

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Can't find "Android SDK Command-line Tools"?**
- Make sure you're on the **"SDK Tools"** tab (not "SDK Platforms")
- Scroll down in the list
- Look for "Command-line Tools (latest)"
- It might also be called "Android SDK Command-line Tools"

**Download is slow?**
- This is normal, it's ~100MB
- Should take 1-3 minutes depending on internet speed
- Don't close Android Studio while downloading

**Already installed?**
- If you see it's already checked, great!
- Just close SDK Manager
- Come back and tell me "cmdline tools installed"

---

## 📞 What to Tell Me

After you complete the installation, just type:

**"cmdline tools installed"**

or

**"done"**

or

**"installed"**

Then I'll automatically run all the remaining steps to build your APK!
